# Rainfall_Prediction_Classifier
I built a model to predict rainfall using Australian dataset
The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package/).\
The column meaning were gotten from the Australina Government's Bureau of Meteorology [link](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/IDCJDW0000.shtml).

The dataset contains observations of weathermetrics for each day from 2008 to 2017
